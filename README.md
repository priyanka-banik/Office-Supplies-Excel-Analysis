# Office-Supplies-Excel-Analysis

We have considered a dataset named 'Office Supplies' which contains information about units of products sold by different representatives in various regions along with dates.To unveil meaningful insights from our datasets, we embark on a journey of data refinement which includes,
Removing Duplicates: Eliminating duplicate entries from the dataset to ensure each record is unique and there are no redundancies.
Harmonizing Date Formats: Standardizing the format of dates across the dataset to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.
Standardizing Representative Names: Ensuring that the names of representatives are consistent throughout the dataset. This might involve correcting spelling variations or standardizing abbreviations.
Polishing Unit Prices: Refining unit prices to ensure accuracy and consistency. This could involve rounding off prices and adding appropriate currency symbols.

Finally, an intuitive dashboard is meticulously crafted where, the first graph illustrates the regional average unit prices for each representative, from which we can infer that In the central region, Smith emerges with the highest average unit price, while in the east and west regions, Susan and Thomas respectively exhibit the highest average unit prices. Whereas, the second graph showcases the cumulative units sold by each representative on a date-by-date basis. It reveals that Alex achieved the highest unit sales on 4/10/2014, recording 94 units sold. Similarly, Richard attained the maximum unit sales on 6/1/2015, reaching a total of 95 units sold, and so forth.
